# Power Consumption Forecast - A Sneek Peek

## Overview 

This project analyses and forecast household electric power consumption using the Series Model. The primary goal is to understand consumption patterns and predict future usage. We used various Time series Techniques to achieve this.


## Business Understanding

Understand Household Electricity Consumption Patterns: The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the household's electricity consumption patterns over time. This includes analyzing the trends, seasonality, and any other relevant patterns in the various electricity-related variables.
Identify Factors Influencing Electricity Consumption: The project aims to identify the key factors that influence the household's electricity consumption, such as time of day, day of the week, seasons, and the usage of specific appliances (sub-metering data).
Develop Predictive Models: Using the time series data, the project may involve developing predictive models to forecast future electricity consumption patterns. This could help the household better manage its energy usage and costs.
Optimize Energy Efficiency: The insights gained from the analysis can be used to identify opportunities for improving energy efficiency within the household, such as identifying high-consumption appliances or periods of the day/week with peak demand. Potential Business Applications:
Household Energy Management: The analysis can help the household better understand its energy consumption patterns and make informed decisions to optimize energy usage and reduce costs.
Utility Company Insights: The project's findings could provide valuable insights to utility companies about residential electricity consumption patterns, which could aid in grid management, demand forecasting, and the development of targeted energy efficiency programs.
Energy Policy and Planning: The project's insights could contribute to the development of energy policies and planning initiatives that aim to promote energy efficiency and sustainability at the household and community levels.
Research and Development: The dataset and analysis could be used for further research and development in the areas of smart home technologies, energy management systems, and the optimization of household energy consumption. Overall, this time series project on household electricity consumption has the potential to provide valuable insights that can benefit the household, utility companies, policymakers, and researchers in the energy and sustainability domains.
